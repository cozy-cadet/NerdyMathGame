This is a simple maze based game, with some twists ofcourse!
The player is placed on the start point inside a closed maze. You are given 4 directions to move in with a Bird-Eye view! You'll either hit walls, or proceed to the next step.
Either way, you are thrown a pair of questions at you after every step, and you answer them. The goal is to reach the end of the maze.
You start with a 100HP and 0IQ.
For every Question you get wrong, You loose HP and IQ.
Answer right and it increases your attributes!
Not just that, for every 5 seconds that pass by, your HP decreases.

How to determine winners, losers or Rankings you ask ?

Play the game individually, and compare your HP and IQ!
ADIOS!
